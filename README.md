## What is this?

This project combines Pi-hole and Unbound into a powerful network solution:

- **Pi-hole** provides network-wide ad blocking and DNS filtering
- **Unbound** functions as a recursive DNS resolver for enhanced privacy
- **Docker** isolates these services for better security and easier management

The included scripts make installation and management simple even for beginners.

## Features

- üîç **Ad blocking** - Network-wide protection against ads and trackers
- üîí **Privacy protection** - Your own recursive DNS resolver with DNSSEC validation
- üåê **Macvlan networking** - Pi-hole appears as a separate device on your network
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Easy configuration** - Edit settings directly from your host system
- üîÑ **One-click updates** - Keep everything current with minimal effort
- üé® **User-friendly scripts** - Color-coded output and status icons for clarity
- ‚úÖ **Interactive setup** - Clear prompts guide you through the process

## Requirements

- üêß Linux system (tested on Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora)
- üîß `bash` shell and `sudo` privileges
- üñß Physical network interface for macvlan (e.g., `eth0`)
- üì¶ Internet connection for downloading containers

## Installation

### One-Command Installation

Use this single command to install everything automatically:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sakis-tech/docker-pihole-unbound/main/install-pihole-unbound.sh)"
```

### What happens during installation:

1. **Prerequisite check** - Docker, Docker Compose, Git, and other required tools
2. **Interactive configuration** - You'll be prompted for:
   - Network details (interface, subnet, IP address)
   - Pi-hole settings (password, web port, theme)
   - Optional Portainer installation for container management
3. **Docker network setup** - Creates a macvlan network for your Pi-hole
4. **Container deployment** - Pulls and launches the Pi-hole with Unbound container
5. **Optional cleanup** - Remove all files except docker-compose.yaml and .env if desired

### After installation

1. Access the Pi-hole admin interface at `http://<Pi-hole_IP>:<Web_Port>`
2. Log in with the password you set during installation
3. Configure your devices to use the Pi-hole IP as their DNS server

## Configuration

### Unbound Configuration Setup

After your Pi-hole + Unbound installation is running, use this script to set up convenient host-based configuration:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sakis-tech/docker-pihole-unbound/main/setup-pihole-unbound.sh)"
```

#### What the setup script does:

1. **Automatically finds** your Pi-hole installation directory
2. **Creates** a configuration directory structure on your host
3. **Downloads** the Unbound configuration from GitHub
4. **Updates** docker-compose.yaml to mount the host configuration
5. **Restarts** the container with the new configuration

After running this script, you can edit Unbound configuration files directly on your host system without needing to access the container.

### User-Friendly Experience

All scripts in this project feature:

- **Color-coded output** for better readability
  - Blue headers for section titles
  - Green text for successful operations
  - Yellow notices for warnings and important information

- **Progress indicators** with informative icons
- **Clear confirmations** before any major changes
- **Detailed feedback** throughout the process

## Updating Your Installation

To update Pi-hole and Unbound to the latest versions, run:

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sakis-tech/docker-pihole-unbound/main/update-pihole-unbound.sh)"
```

### Update Process

The update script automatically:

1. **Locates** your Pi-hole installation directory
2. **Records** current Pi-hole and Unbound versions
3. **Downloads** the latest Docker images
4. **Restarts** containers with the updated images
5. **Shows version changes** comparing old and new versions
6. **Tests DNS resolution** against common domains
7. **Displays** your current configuration
8. **Shows** container logs if requested

### Update Features

- **Version tracking**: Shows what changed from the previous to the new version
- **Configuration protection**: Ensures your settings are preserved during updates
- **Health checks**: Tests DNS resolution functionality after updates
- **Diagnostic information**: Gives troubleshooting tips if any issues are detected

## Project Structure

After installation, your project will have this structure:

```
docker-pihole-unbound/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yaml  # Container configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                 # Environment variables
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unbound/             # Custom Unbound configuration directory
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ custom.conf      # Custom DNS resolver settings
```

The configuration data is stored in Docker named volumes for better portability and permission management:

```
Docker Volumes:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pihole    # Pi-hole configuration storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dnsmasq   # DNS configuration storage
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unbound   # Unbound configuration storage
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing Unbound DNS Resolver

After running the setup script, you can customize Unbound by editing:

```
./unbound/custom.conf
```

This file contains custom configuration options for your DNS resolver including DNSSEC settings, caching parameters, and other DNS-related options. The default configuration already includes recommended DNSSEC validation settings.

### Applying Configuration Changes

After making changes to any configuration files, restart the container:

```bash
docker compose restart pihole-unbound
```

### Additional Pi-hole Settings

While most Pi-hole settings can be managed through the web interface, advanced configurations can be found in:

```
./config/pihole/
```

### Common Tasks

- **View Pi-hole logs**: `docker compose logs pihole-unbound`
- **Access Pi-hole container**: `docker compose exec pihole-unbound bash`
- **Update gravity list**: `docker compose exec pihole-unbound pihole -g`

## Troubleshooting

### Container Issues
- **Container not starting**: Check logs with `docker compose logs pihole-unbound`
- **Permission problems**: If you've added your user to the docker group, log out and back in

### Network Issues
- **Network connectivity issues**: Verify your macvlan configuration matches your network settings
- **DNS resolution problems**: Ensure your router is correctly forwarding DNS queries to Pi-hole
- **Can't access admin interface**: Check if the IP address and port are correct

### DNS Functionality
- **Some domains not resolving**: Check for domain-specific blocks in Pi-hole's query log
- **Slow DNS resolution**: Verify your upstream DNS servers in Unbound configuration

### DNS Resolution Issues

- If you cannot access Pi-hole's web interface, make sure the port mapping in the Docker Compose file is correctly set.
- If DNS resolution doesn't work, ensure that your router/DHCP server points to Pi-hole's IP for DNS, or manually configure your devices.

### macvlan Network Configuration

This setup uses macvlan networking to give Pi-hole its own dedicated IP address on your network. Important notes about this configuration:

- Pi-hole DNS service works properly for all network devices
- The host machine cannot directly communicate with the container (macvlan limitation)
- Update script's external DNS tests will report failures when run from the host
- Internal DNS tests run from inside the container will pass, confirming DNS is working correctly

#### Recommended Host Configuration with macvlan

When using macvlan, the host machine cannot directly reach the container. To allow DNS resolution on the host:

1. Configure your router as the DNS server in `/etc/resolv.conf` on the host:
   ```
   nameserver 192.168.10.1  # Replace with your router's IP
   ```

2. Configure your router to use Pi-hole (192.168.10.20) as its DNS server

This creates a path where: Host ‚Üí Router ‚Üí Pi-hole ‚Üí Internet

## Network Configuration

The installer creates a Docker macvlan network called `pihole_macvlan` that allows the Pi-hole container to appear as a separate physical device on your network with its own IP address.

This approach has several benefits:
- Direct accessibility from all network devices
- Can function as your network's DHCP server if desired
- Cleaner network architecture (no port forwarding required)
